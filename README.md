## PQC TLS evaluation
The following project explores and compares the performance of a PQC cryptographic stack configuration compared to a traditional one.
The objective is to understand how feasible a post quantum transition would be, especially for constrained devices.

The report explains precisely the steps to tak to set the environment and repeat the experiments.
This work was inspired on the work of Lopez, Cadena, et al. which can be found here:
